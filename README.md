INTRODUCTION
Football analytics has become an essential tool for understanding and improving player performance,
match strategies, and overall team outcomes. This project leverages data from the StatsBomb API to
create a comprehensive analysis tool using Streamlit. It allows users to explore match data, visualize
player and team metrics, and gain insights through interactive visualizations.

OBJECTIVES
To provide a user-friendly platform for analyzing football matches and player statistics. To visualize key
aspects of matches, such as heatmaps, pass networks, and team formations. To explore predictive
modeling techniques for analyzing football data.

FEATURES AND IMPLEMENTATION

By leveraging advanced technologies and data science techniques, we can extract valuable
information from match data to inform strategic decisions, improve training regimens, and enhance
the overall fan experience.
Key Features:
1. Data Collection and Integration:

○ Real-time tracking data: Collect player tracking data using statbombs api which
stores data (position, speed, acceleration, etc.) collected using wearable devices or
video analysis tools .
○ Event data: Capture events like goals, shots, tackles, passes, and fouls using this
collected data by effectively preprocessing it.



2. Performance Metrics and Analysis:

○ Player performance metrics:
■ Individual player statistics (goals, assists, shots, passes, tackles, etc.)
■ Player workload.
■ Player movement patterns and heat maps
■ Player passing networks and efficiency
○ Team performance metrics:
■ Possession statistics
■ Shot conversion rates
■ Defensive pressure and intensity

3. Advanced Analytics:

○ Machine learning models: Use machine learning algorithms to predict match
outcomes, identify key performance indicators, and detect patterns in player and team
behavior.
○ Statistical analysis: Employ statistical techniques (e.g., hypothesis testing, correlation
analysis) to quantify the significance of performance metrics.
○ Data visualization: Create interactive visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs, heat maps)
to communicate insights effectively.

4. Tactical Analysis:
○ Formation analysis: Analyze team formations and tactical setups.
○ Set-piece analysis: Study set-piece strategies (corners, free kicks, penalties) to
identify strengths and weaknesses.
○ Opponent analysis: Analyze opponent's strengths, weaknesses, and preferred tactics to develop effective counter-strategies.
